Beta's superpower is Data Analysis.

The early spring: Beta and Bit are walking in the park.

Suddenly, a big dog runs next to Bit.

I wonder how much this giant weighs?

You could weigh it on a scale.

But how? I can't even lift him. And I don't have a scale.

You could weigh it as it as they do with trees.

How to weigh huge trees? Nobody digs them out and puts them on a scale. So how? Scientists are searching for a relationship between the things that can be easily measured, e.g. height, and those that are hard to measure, e.g. weight.

By knowing this relationship we may estimate weight from height. Such relationships can be easily seen on charts. With the use of charts we may also read the mean weight of trees with a specified height. Let's use this method to weigh a dog with a ruler.

Let's find the data about the size and weight of some different dog breeds. Then, we find a relationship between those two features and estimate the dog's weight! Will you help us to do it?

Take a ruler and a pencil. We will weigh a dog with a ruler in only three steps!

Bit found a table with different dog breeds' data on the Internet. Now, you should mark on the chart on your right the weight and height of breeds, mentioned in the table.

Take a ruler and try to draw a straight line which is as close as possible to all of the points. It doesn't have to go through all of the points but try to make it as close as possible (*).

(*) Finding the line which fits best requires university level mathematics. In this way we will find a more or less approximate solution.

Height Weight

Chihuahua
Yorkshire
Terrier
Bearded collie
Chow Chow
Akita
Newfoundland
Mastiff

Do it yourself! Fill in the chart!

Height [cm]
Weight [kg]

How heavy is 60 cm high dog? (1) Mark this size on the horizontal line. (2) Draw a vertical line through it. (3) Try to read what weight the height of the dog corresponds to. What is your result?

A lot of work to weigh a dog. It is much easier to drag him on a scale!

It may be easier with a dog. But this method may weigh heavier objects too.

We can weigh planets as well as stars by estimating their weight based on their size and density.

We can weigh dinosaurs too, in spite of the fact that they have been extinct for a long time ago and today we have only their skeletons or imprints on a rock. Let us take such a T-Rex. From the excavations, it is known that they were 10 meter high. But how much did they weigh?


# Page 7

Do it yourself! Find T-Rex's weight.

Height
Weight

Kitti's hog-nosed bat
Wood mouse
Red squirrel
Side-striped jackal
Wombat
Capybara
Man
Polar bear
Giraffe
African elephant
Blue whale

In the above-mentioned chart the height and weight of different animals was marked. From a small bat to a giant whale. Having such a combination try to estimate how much the 10-meter dinosaur weighed.

(1) Draw a line passing close to the marked points, as you did for the dogs.

(2) Having such a relationship estimate T-Rex's weight (*), find out what weight corresponds to 10 meters of height.

(*) Until today scientists are not unanimous on how much these giants weighed. Different model predictions vary from 4.5 to 10 ton. And what was your result?

Water
Maple syrup
Ice-cream syrup
Fudge
Caramel candies
Nougat 
Toffee 
Lollipop 
Caramelized sugar


Boiling point [Â°C]
Sugar concentration [%]

You are not saying that we can weigh everything with a ruler and it is always such a simple relation. 

Not everything but a lot of things. Even if not with a straight line, but then it is a bit more complicated.

The sweetest one is shown by the sugar curve. It is used by confectioners who warm up the syrup to higher and higher temperatures.

Confectioners may measure the sugar concentration with a thermometer - by measuring the boiling point of a solution. Thanks to this they know how long they should warm up the syrup in order to make thick fudges or hard lollipops.

It is nice to make such sweet measurements!
