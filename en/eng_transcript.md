Suddenly, a big dog runs up to Bit.

I wonder how much this giant weighs?

You could weigh him on a scale.

But how? I can't even lift him. And I don't have a scale.

You could weigh him the way trees are weighed.

How to weigh huge trees? Nobody digs them up and places them on a scale after all. So how? The scientists are searching for a relationship between things that can be easily measured, e.g. height, and those that are hard to measure, e.g. weight.

By knowing this relationship we can estimate weight from height. Such relationships can be easily seen on charts. With the use of charts we can also find the mean weight of the trees with a specified height. Let's use this method to weigh a dog using a ruler.

Let's find some data about the size and weight of some different dog breeds. Then we will find the relationship between these two features and estimate the dog's weight! Will you help us to do it?

Take a ruler and a pencil. We will weigh a dog using a ruler in only three steps!

Bit has found a table with different dog breeds' data on the Internet. Now, you should mark on the chart on the right the weight and height of the breeds, as mentioned in the table.

Take a ruler and try to draw a line that passes all the points as close as possible. It doesn't have to go through all possible points but try to make it as close as possible. *

*Academic mathematics is needed to find the line that fits the best, but this method will give us an approximate solution.

Height Weight

Chihuahua
Yorkshire
Terrier
Bearded Collie
Chow Chow
Akita
Newfoundland
Mastiff

Do it yourself! Fill in the chart!

Height [cm]
Weight [kg]

How heavy is a 60-centimetre tall dog? (1) Mark this size on the horizontal line. (2) Draw a vertical line through it. (3) Try to read what weight the height of the dog corresponds to. What is your result?

That's a lot of work to weigh a dog. It's much easier to put him on a scale!

It may be easier with a dog. But this method can be used to weigh heavier objects.

We can weigh planets as well as stars by estimating their weight based on their size and density.

We can weigh dinosaurs too, in spite of the fact that they died out a long time ago and today we have only their skeletons or imprints on a rock. Take a T-Rex, for example. From the excavations, we know that they were 10 metres tall. But how much did they weigh?

Do it yourself! Find T-Rex's weight.

Kitti's Hog-Nosed Bat
Wood Mouse
Red Squirrel
Side-Striped Jackal
Wombat
Capybara
Man
Polar Bear
Giraffe
African Elephant
Blue Whale

On the above-mentioned chart it was marked the height and weight of different animals. From a small bat to a giant whale. Having such a combination try to estimate how much the 10-meter dinosaur weighed.

(1) Draw a line passing close to the marked points, as you did for the dogs.

(2) Based on the relationship between height and weight, estimate T-Rex's weight. * Find out what weight corresponds to 10 metres of height.

* Up until now, scientists have not all agreed about how much these giants weighed. Different models vary from 4.5 to 10 tons. And what was your result?

You're not saying that we can weigh everything with a ruler and there's always such a simple relationship between data.

Not everything but a lot of things. Even if it doesn't work with a straight line, then the method is only a little more complicated.

The sweetest substance is shown by the sugar curve. It is used by confectioners who warm up the syrup to higher and higher temperatures.

Confectioners can measure the sugar concentration with a thermometer, - by measuring the boiling point of a solution. From this they know how long they should warm up the syrup in order to make thick fudges or hard lollipops.

It's nice to make such sweet measurements!
